## Description

This is a quite simple API, built to take part in NTT Data's tech challenge, in which we consume omdbapi's API to retrieve and sanitize data from movies, while sending back a DTO to our client.

## :computer: Technologies and Concepts

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- NestJS

## :rocket: Routes (only 1 route)

```yml
GET /movies/:title
    - Searches for a movie on a 3rd party API, cleans up the data and sends it back to the client.
    - headers: {}
    - response: {
    "title": "",
    "actors": "",
    "poster": "",
    "plot": "",
    "review": number from 0 to 5
    }
```
